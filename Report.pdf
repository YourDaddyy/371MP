Part 1 Determine Requirements:

200 OK
Description:    The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested resource.
Requirements:   The request must be valid, well-formed, and target a file that exists on the server.
Method: GET
Test: Use a valid GET request with an existing file, like test.html, to trigger the response.
Request Example:
GET /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

304 Not Modified
Description:    The requested resource has not been modified since the date specified in the If-Modified-Since header.
Requirements:   The request must include an If-Modified-Since header with a timestamp.  The server checks the last modified time of the requested resource. If it hasnâ€™t been modified since that time, it returns 304 Not Modified.
Method: GET
Test: Use a GET request with the If-Modified-Since header and specify a time after the last modification of the file.
Request Example:
GET /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT

400 Bad Request
Description:    The server cannot understand the request due to malformed syntax.
Requirements:   The request must be improperly formatted, missing required components, or contain invalid syntax.
This could happen if the request line or headers are incorrect.
Method: Any HTTP method can result in a 400 error if the syntax is invalid.
Test: Use an invalid or incomplete HTTP request to trigger a 400 Bad Request.
Request Example:
GET /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host

404 Not Found
Description:    The server could not find the requested resource.
Requirements:   The request must target a resource that does not exist on the server.
Method: GET
Test: Use a valid GET request for a non-existent file.
Request Example:
GET /nonexistent.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

501 Not Implemented
Description:    The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
Requirements:   The request must use an HTTP method that the server does not support (for example, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Test: Use an unsupported HTTP method such as POST to trigger the 501 Not Implemented response.
Request Example:
POST /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
